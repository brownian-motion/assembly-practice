These are simple programs hand-written in assembly.
They are primarily examples for me to show people.

All of these programs are written in Intel-style asm unless otherwise specified.

## Running
These are meant to be run on https://www.mycompiler.io/new/asm-x86_64 , which provides a simple unified environment to run with an online compiler.
I have also included Makefiles you can use to run this on x86_64 machines running Linux, using `make run`.
These require `nasm` and `ld`.
